# project-1("DeceptiConf")
This homepage captures the essence of DeceptiConf, a design conference dedicated to exploring the cutting-edge dark patterns in web design. With a sleek, modern aesthetic, it seamlessly conveys the conference's theme of innovation on the darker side of UX. The design's minimalistic yet impactful layout draws attention to the key information while maintaining a professional and tech-savvy vibe. The carefully chosen typography and color palette reflect the event's focus on advanced, somewhat clandestine design strategies, perfectly tailored for an audience of forward-thinking, tech-savvy professionals.
